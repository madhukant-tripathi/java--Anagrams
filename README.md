This project contains a Java program that generates all possible anagrams of a given word.
An anagram is formed by rearranging the letters of a word.

For example, if the input word is SIX, the program displays the anagrams:
SIX, IXS, XSI, ISX, SXI, and XIS.

The program is written in Java and can be compiled and run using a Java compiler.
